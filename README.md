# Face-Detection-and-Classification

This repository contains a face detection and classification model developed from scratch using eigen faces, eigen values, principal component analysis (PCA), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms in MATLAB.

The model is trained on a dataset of facial images and can accurately detect and classify new images into different categories based on facial features and patterns. The eigen faces and eigen values are used to represent the facial images in a lower-dimensional space, allowing for faster and more efficient processing.

The PCA algorithm is used to reduce the dimensionality of the facial images, while preserving the most important features. The KNN algorithm is then used to classify the images based on the distance between the new image and the training set images.

This repository includes all the MATLAB code and resources needed to train and test the face detection and classification model. The code includes detailed documentation and instructions for use.

Overall, this model provides a robust and accurate solution for facial image detection and classification, with potential applications in security systems, biometric identification, and image recognition technologies.
